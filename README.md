ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @takedacodes

I'm still learning what I'm interested in. I have junior experience coding specific to analytics and data type stuff. But my goal is to get more experienced and advanced. 
I think the next step in my career is in solutions architecture or DevOps maybe even Front End Development or maybe building the next best SaaS to serve a purpose that I'm passionate about. 

I appreciate how the world is collaborative and how there's so many insightful people out there. By all means, let's connect and share ideas! I do my best to share what I know in the best way I know how via a digital garden and articles on the interwebs ;) 

Some of my favorite things:
- Sustainability and environmental justice
- Inclusive and accessible technology

Stuff on my learning plan:
- Python
- JavaScript
